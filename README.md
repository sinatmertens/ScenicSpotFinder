AI-driven analysis of user content to update and enrich maps

The goal is to leverage ML to extract meaningful insights from text and image data generated by users, such as reviews and uploaded photos related to specific trails or locations. These insights can then be used to update maps with current conditions, new POIs, or highlight scenic spots.
